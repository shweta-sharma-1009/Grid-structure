Explanation:
This code defines a basic webpage layout using HTML and links a stylesheet for styling. It consists of two main sections: navigation and an image. 
The navigation is contained within a "container" element, and it includes buttons and an image representing a logo. The image section also resides in the same "container" element and displays an image using a base64-encoded source.


CSS - 
This CSS code is like a set of instructions to style a webpage layout. Imagine you're arranging things on a grid paper.

Margins: You're making sure there's no extra space around the whole webpage.

Container: Think of it as a big box where everything goes. This box is divided into rows and columns, like graph paper. It's a black box with a white border. Inside, there are 6 rows, each as tall as 6 bookmarks stacked on top of each other. And there are 16 columns, each about as wide as 6% of the box.

First Box (g1): Imagine the first row of the box. It's a big box itself that stretches across all columns. Inside, you're putting things in the middle of the box, both horizontally and vertically. Like arranging stuff neatly in the center.

Navigation: This is like a menu at the top. The buttons are spaced out and have a black background with white writing. They're like black cards with white text on them.

Other Boxes (g2 to g10): Imagine the grid again. Now, you're placing more boxes in different spots. Some are wide, some are narrow. They're like little containers where you can put things.

Items: These are things inside the small boxes. They look like small cards with white borders and backgrounds. They're spaced a bit from each other.

So, in simpler terms, this code helps arrange and style the parts of a webpage. It's like putting items in rows and columns, making sure they look nice with colors, borders, and spacing.
